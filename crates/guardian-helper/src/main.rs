//! `guardian-helper` — G7's narrow privileged production process (ADR-002
//! Model B; G7 implementation handoff §2). Owns
//! `io.github.cliffthelin.GuardianHelper1` on the real system bus and is
//! the sole process that ever performs a Guardian-owned privileged
//! mutation (Class A, G7 handoff §2.4/§2.5). Clients call this process
//! *directly* — `guardian-daemon` has no code path that reaches this
//! binary's mutation method on a client's behalf (G7 handoff §2.3).
//!
//! The one bounded Class A operation this evidence build exposes
//! (`GuardedWrite`) drives the complete, unmodified G4 transaction engine
//! (Snapshot → Validate → Authorize → Apply → Observe → Confirm/Rollback)
//! entirely in-process, against a minimal typed, genuinely idempotent
//! counter adapter — narrow and typed, per §40's forbidden-shortcuts list;
//! not a generic broker.
//!
//! **Recovery (repair of the independent audit's primary blocking

//! clearly terminate nonterminal transaction state." Startup recovery
//! here does not merely classify and log — for every
//! [`RecoveryClassification`] it either resumes the transaction from
