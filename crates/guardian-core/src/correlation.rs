//! TDD-contract Phase 2, Gate 2a: the Layer-1 correlation engine
//! (implementation handoff §4/§6/§7; TDD contract §51). Pure, deterministic
//! Rust -- no `guardian-daemon` wiring, no D-Bus, no `/proc`/`/sys` reads,
//! no real provider I/O. This module owns exactly the 19 Gate 2a normative
//! IDs: `P2-EVT-001..004`, `P2-COR-001..007`, `P2-INC-002..004`,
//! `P2-REC-001..005`. `P2-INC-001` is retired (severity deferred in full,
//! TDD contract §51 "Severity/wire disposition") and is not reintroduced
//! here: [`crate::incident::Incident`] gains no new field.
//!
//! # `CorrelationIngress` and ingress order (§6)
//!
//! All correlation grouping, windowing, and ordering is defined over
//! `(ingress_clock, ingress_sequence)` -- never over a producer's own
//! `Event::timestamp_monotonic`, which real production code sets
//! incompatibly across producers (`guardian-daemon.rs`'s wall-clock
//! `now_secs()` vs. `providers/psi.rs`'s per-instance sequence counter).
//! [`IngressClock`] is the small, test/daemon-usable helper that
//! constructs [`CorrelationIngress`] records at the single admission
//! point every event source feeds through; a fresh instance begins a
//! fresh ordering epoch at sequence 0 (`P2-EVT-004`), matching the
//! restart-epoch semantics §6/§9 require.
//!
//! # Three bounded structures (§7)
//!
//! 1. Open-incident cap (`CorrelationPolicy::open_incident_cap`):
//!    force-closes the oldest-by-ingress-order open incident on overflow
//!    (`P2-INC-002`).
//! 2. Closed-incident ring (`CorrelationPolicy::closed_incident_cap`):
//!    FIFO-drops the oldest closed incident on overflow (`P2-INC-003`).
//! 3. Debounce/dwell ring (`CorrelationPolicy::debounce_capacity`):
//!    reject-not-evict -- a brand-new candidate key is rejected
//!    (`AdmitOutcome::CapacityRejected`) at capacity; existing tracked
//!    candidates are never disturbed (`P2-REC-001`/`P2-REC-004`).
//!
//! # `CapacityRejected` observability (`P2-REC-003`/`P2-REC-005`)
//!
//! A `CapacityRejected` outcome increments a bounded/saturating rejection
//! counter ([`CorrelationEngine::rejection_count`]) and is returned as
//! typed data ([`AdmitOutcome::CapacityRejected`] carrying
//! [`CapacityRejected`]) -- that is the entirety of this gate's owned
//! behavior. **Gate 2a performs no daemon-shaped I/O of its own.** The
//! physical operational log line (`guardian-daemon`'s existing
//! `eprintln!("[guardian-daemon] ...")` convention -- confirmed, by
//! reading `crates/guardian-daemon/src/bin/guardian-daemon.rs` directly,
//! to be the only logging convention anywhere in this workspace) is a
//! file-impact assignment the implementation handoff's §20 gives
//! explicitly to `crates/guardian-daemon/src/bin/guardian-daemon.rs`
//! under **Gate 2b**, not to this library crate: "the debounce ring's
//! `CapacityRejected` log line uses this file's existing
//! `eprintln!(...)` convention, not a new logging facility" (§20,
//! describing the Gate-2b-modified `guardian-daemon.rs`, not
//! `guardian-core`). A library crate performing `eprintln!` on its own
//! initiative -- impersonating a daemon process that, from Gate 2a's
//! perspective, does not exist yet -- is exactly the layering smell no
//! other library crate in this workspace exhibits. Everything Gate 2b
//! will need to perform that real log write later is already exposed
//! here as typed/queryable state: the rejected candidate's
//! `capability_id` and the post-rejection `rejection_count`, both on
//! [`CapacityRejected`] itself, plus the running total via
//! [`CorrelationEngine::rejection_count`]. By rule, a rejection never
//! constructs or feeds another [`crate::event::Event`] into
//! [`CorrelationIngress`] or any other correlation input path -- see
//! [`AdmitOutcome::CapacityRejected`] and
//! [`CorrelationEngine::admitted_ingress_count`].
//!
//! # Scope this module deliberately does NOT cover
//!
//! No real provider-health snapshot-diff producer (Gate 2b); no daemon
//! wiring or `Incidents1` population (Gate 2b); no VM evidence (Gate 2c);
//! no incident severity (deferred in full, §51); no
//! [`crate::budget::evaluate`]/[`crate::budget::evaluate_with_alternatives`]
//! call anywhere on this grouping path (`P2-REC-002`) -- this module does
//! not import `crate::budget` at all.
