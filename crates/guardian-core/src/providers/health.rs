//! TDD-contract Phase 2, Gate 2b: the provider-health transition `Event`
//! producer (implementation handoff §4.2/§13; gate TDD R1). Diffs two
//! successive `capability_registry_tick` snapshots and emits one `Event`
//! per `capability_id` whose `Health` or `Availability` changed, in the
//! exact shape Gate 2a's `CorrelationEngine` already expects
//! ([`crate::correlation::HEALTH_TRANSITION_EVENT_TYPE`]).
//!
//! REQUIRED FOUNDATION only (gate TDD R1 scope note): this module produces
//! one generic Availability/Health signal, identical in shape across every
//! provider in the G8 Capability Registry. Per-source enrichment (`UDisks2`
//! device identity, logind inhibitor detail, `UPower` battery/AC detail,
//! `AccountsService` session specifics) is OPTIONAL FUTURE ENRICHMENT and is
//! deliberately not attempted here.
//!
//! Pure Rust, no I/O of any kind: this module never reads `/proc`, never
//! opens a D-Bus connection, and never constructs a
//! [`crate::correlation::CorrelationIngress`]/[`crate::correlation::
//! IngressClock`] of its own — `guardian-daemon` (Gate 2b's daemon-wiring
//! half) owns the single ingress admission point every event source feeds
//! through (gate TDD R2); this module only ever hands it plain [`Event`]
//! values to admit.
